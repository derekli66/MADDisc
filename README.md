MADDisc
=======

## Project Description

This project had been published on App Store in 2011 and lasted for few months. This project created a carousal and a pointer that helps people to make a decision right away. People can set up different conditions and even those are without any relationship between each other. Then, use the finger tip to make pointer spinning around on the carousal. 

## Future Work

MADDisc is still an non-ARC project. I will not change it to ARC because it reminds me that **Don't forget the basic and don't leave the memory management away**. I am still refactoring it.  

This project is open sourced for everyone to discover something useful.   

## Milestone

MADDisc was in the top 20 of newly apps recommendation on App Store in 2011.
